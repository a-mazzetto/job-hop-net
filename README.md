# Job Hop Net - Job Network Data Analysis

![JobHopNets](figures/job-hop-net.jpg)

## The Project

Job Hop Net started as a project at university, with the idea to explore the information publicly available on professional networks and the useful insights that can be extracted from it. A full report of the study can be found in _job-hop-net-report.pdf_, source code and data in the _code_ and _data_ folders respectively. Due to the small size of the raw dataset, that is not publicly available as, despite anonymization, it is theoretically possible to identify a person from their career path; only the aggregated job-hop network data is available.

## Future of the project

If you find this study interesting or want to have access to the raw data for a school or university project, please get in touch. If anyone would like to collaborate, the idea is to increase the dataset size and improve on the techniques. Some of the areas to work on:

* Web scraping to augment the dataset;
* Ethics and privacy, k-anonymity calculation;
* Text data analysis: improvement of company and role parsing;
* Network data analysis: extend to job-role network.

After augmenting the dataset and after ensuring the highest level of anonymity the idea is to make the dataset open source.
